# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegreee
Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree projects.

This repository contains project files for Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree program which I started working on on 23 July, 2017.

The Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree is an online certification intended to introduce students to the broad field of artificial intelligence, and prepare them for a wide variety of opportunities in the AI field.


## Program Outline:

### Part 1: Foundation of AI 

- Project 1: Solve Sudoku

  In this project, I implemented two extensions of the sudoku solver. The first one is to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one is to solve a diagonal sudoku.

- Project 2: Build an Adversarial Search Agent

  The goal of this project is to develop an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation". Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.

- Project 3: Creat an Domain-Independent Planner

  In this project, the goal is to define a group of problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain. I then set up the problems for search, experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, to solve the problems, and then provide an analysis of the results.
  
- Project 4: Build a Sign Language Recognizer

### Part 2: Deep Learning and Applications

### Part 3: Computer Vision

### Part 4: Natural Language Processing

### Part 5: Voice User Interfaces
