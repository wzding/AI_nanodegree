# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegreee
Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree projects.

This repository contains project files for Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree program which I started working on on 23 July, 2017.

The Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree is an online certification intended to introduce students to the broad field of artificial intelligence, and prepare them for a wide variety of opportunities in the AI field.


## Program Outline:

### Part 1: Foundation of AI 

- Project 1: [Solve a Sudoku with AI](https://github.com/wzding/Artificial_Intelligence_Nanodegree/tree/master/Sudoku)

  In this project, I implemented two extensions of the sudoku solver. The first one is to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one is to solve a diagonal sudoku.

- Project 2: [Build an Adversarial Search Agent](https://github.com/wzding/Artificial_Intelligence_Nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-Isolation)

  The goal of this project was to develop an adversarial search agent to play the game "Isolation". Isolation is a deterministic, two-player game of perfect information in which the players alternate turns moving a single piece from one cell to another on a board. Whenever either player occupies a cell, that cell becomes blocked for the remainder of the game. The first player with no remaining legal moves loses, and the opponent is declared the winner.

- Project 3: [Creat an Domain-Independent Planner](https://github.com/wzding/Artificial_Intelligence_Nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-Planning)

  In this project, the goal was to define a group of problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain. To solve air cargo logistics problems, I decomposed them into individual actions using a formal planning framework, identifying dependencies and effects of each action, and generating valid plans using search techniques. I then set up the problems for search, experimented with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, to solve the problems, and then provide an analysis of the results.
  
- Project 4: [Build a Sign Language Recognizer](https://github.com/wzding/Artificial_Intelligence_Nanodegree/tree/master/AIND-Recognizer)

  Used Hidden Markov Models to recognize gestures in American Sign Language, from individual words to complete sentences. Trained it on a dataset of videos that have been pre-processed and annotated, and tested on novel sequences. Improved the recognizer by finding the best English translation of each sentence.
